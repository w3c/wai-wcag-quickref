					<strong>This is a first, unapproved mockup of the new How to Meet WCAG 2.0 page.</strong> <a href="#devnotes" data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="devnotes">More notes:</a>

					<li>This is not the final design nor the final functionality.</li>
          <li>There is content missing, for example:
            <ul>
              <li>Not all Success Criteria have been imported.</li>
              <li>Currently only WCAG techniques are present in this mockup, I will add links to other supporting documents in the next few days.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
					<li>Customization is just shaping up.
            <ul>
              <li>Currently only the selection of the Levels is working.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Please look at</strong> the general impression. Compare with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">current “How to Meet” document</a>, assume that all categories and content are in there. Focus on the <a href="#filters">customization panel</a> on the top of the page and the general framework.</p>
