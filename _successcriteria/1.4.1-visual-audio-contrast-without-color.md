Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

*Note:* This success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other forms of perception are covered in [Guideline 1.3](#content-structure-separation) including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding.
