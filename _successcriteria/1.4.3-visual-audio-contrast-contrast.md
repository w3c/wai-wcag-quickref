    - future: Using a higher contrast value for text that is over a patterned background
    - future: Using Unicode text and style sheets instead of images of text
    - future: Using a higher contrast values for lines in diagrams
    - future: Using greater contrast level for red-black text/background combinations
    - future: Using colors that are composed predominantly of mid spectral components for the light and spectral extremes (blue and red wavelengths) for the dark
    - future: Using a light pastel background rather than a white background behind black text to create sufficient but not extreme contrast
    - future: Making icons using simple line drawings that meet the contrast provisions for text
    - future: Providing sufficient contrast ratio in graphs and charts
    - future: Using a 3:1 contrast ratio or higher as the default presentation
    - future: Providing sufficient color contrast for empty text fields
